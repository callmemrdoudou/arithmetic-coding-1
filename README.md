# Arithmetic coding study

## About

This little project is product of a class assignment, coded around March 2016.

It is composed only by three files:

* __Encoder.py__, which is the core and has all the important methods.
* __Utils.py__, which is the core and has all the important methods.
* __main.py__, which allows a direct route to use the methods defined in __Encoder.py__
from the terminal.


## How it works
Although briefly done, almost every method defined in Encoder is explained above its header, thus I'm not explaining it here.

To check how arithmetic coding works, look [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_coding).
